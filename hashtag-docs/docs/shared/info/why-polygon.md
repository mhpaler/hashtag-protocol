## Welcome to our new playground on Polygon Mumbai

For a full rundown of our migration story and updated roadmap see our substack article. 

Running Hashtag Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet proved impossible -- so we pivoted
and are redeploying on Polygon. What you're seeing here a stopover on Polygon
Mumbai before we deploy to Polygon Mainnet.

Please feel free to use this interface to experiment with minting HASHTAG tokens
and tagging digital content with them to a decentralized, globally accessible
database.

We greatly appreciate any feature requests and bug reports (we know there's
quite a few!) before relaunching onto Polygon Mainnet. If you have any, please drop in on our Discord and contact us there.

If you want to mint HASHTAG tokens destined for commercial use, you may
continue to do so over on
[app.hashtag-protocol.org](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org)). Mind you, minting
on Ethereum Mainnet costs $50-100 in gas. However, all HASHTAG tokens minted on Ethereum mainnet will be migrated
before we relaunch on Polygon Mainnet. Therefore, all token provenance,
including hashtag string, creator and publisher will be preserved on Polygon.
