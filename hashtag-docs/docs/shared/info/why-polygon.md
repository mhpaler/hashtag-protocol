## We're migrating to Polygon

**TLDR:** Gas prices on Ethereum Mainnet and a high-volume, Web3 tagging
protocol do not mix well. Therefore we are pivoting and
redeploying Hashtag Protocol on arguably the most battle tested, scalable Layer 2.

If you want to experiment, including tagging content, please head on over to our
new Polygon Mumbai testnet playground at
[dev.hashtag-protocol.org](https://dev.hashtag-protocol.org).

If you want to mint commercial grade HASHTAG tokens you may
continue to do so using this interface (located at
[app.hashtag-protocol.org](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org)). Mind you, minting
costs $50-100 in gas. However, all HASHTAG tokens on Ethereum mainnet will be migrated
before we relaunch on Polygon Mainnet. Therefore, all token provenance,
including hashtag string, creator and publisher will be preserved on Polygon.
