## Welcome to our new sandbox on Polygon Mumbai

### What is this?

You're looking at a demonstration of Hashtag Protocol, a new, experimental Web3 tagging
standard that aims to do for content tagging what ENS, Unstoppable Domains and
Handshake have done for DNS.

With this interface, you can tag any NFT on Ethereum or Polygon with any hashtag string you can imagine. If your
tag is unique, a HASHTAG token (itself an NFT) will be minted and your
address is logged within as the Creator. In the future, if the HASHTAG token is
purchased at auction, the Creator will receive a portion of the sale revenue.

Please note, this sandbox is for **testing purposes only**. Nothing in it has **real
world value** and no tokens or data will migrated to Polygon Mainnet.

[Learn more](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/participants.html) about Publishers, Creators & Taggers, the three
early market participants of the Hashtag Protocol.

### Front-running the opportunity

For Creators, you can be an early adopter and mint HASHTAG tokens on Ethereum Mainnet at
[app.hashtag-protocol.org](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org). Mind you, minting on Mainnet usually costs over $100 in gas!

All HASHTAG tokens on Ethereum Mainnet _will be migrated_
immediately prior to launch on Polygon Mainnet. All token provenance, including hashtag
string, Creator address and Publisher address, _will be preserved_.

For Publishers, we are seeking five "launch partners" who wish to implement
decentralized tagging on their platform. As early adopters, launch partners will have
opportunity to be publisher of record for the highest value HASHTAG tokens.
If a HASHTAG token is purchased at auction, the Publisher of record will receive
a portion of the sale revenue.
