## We're migrating to Polygon

### Why the move?

Simply put: faster & cheaper transactions.

Sadly, a high-volume, Web3 tagging protocol and Ethereum Mainnet are
incompatible. Therefore we are pivoting and redeploying Hashtag Protocol on
Polygon, arguably the most decentralized, battle tested & scalable Layer 2.


### Our new sandbox on Polygon Mumbai testnet

Please use this interface to experiment with tagging any
NFT on Ethereum or Polygon with any hashtag string you can imagine. If the
hashtag you tag with is unique, a HASHTAG token (itself an NFT) will be minted
and your address is logged within it as the Creator. In the future, Creators
will receive a royalty when the HASHTAG token is purchased at auction.

Please note, the Mumbai sandbox is for **testing purposes only**. No tokens or
tagging data will be migrated to Polygon Mainnet.

about Publishers, Creators & Taggers, the three early market participants of the
Hashtag Protocol.

### Early adoption opportunity

For Creators, you can continue use this interface to mint HASHTAG tokens on
Ethereum Mainnet. Mind you, it usually costs over $100 in gas.

All HASHTAG tokens on Ethereum Mainnet will be migrated immediately prior to our
launch on Polygon Mainnet. All token provenance, including hashtag string,
Creator address and Publisher address, will be preserved.

For Publishers, we are seeking five "launch partners" who wish to implement
decentralized tagging on their platform. Launch partners will act as exclusive
Publishers for a limited time (time length tbd).

As early adopters, launch partners will be publisher of record for any HASHTAG
tokens minted on their implementation. If a HASHTAG token is purchased at
auction, the publisher of record will receive a portion of the sale revenue. For
early publishers, this could be quite lucrative.

### What is Hashtag Protocol?

A new Web3 tagging standard that aims to do for content tagging what ENS,
Unstoppable Domains and Handshake have done for DNS.
