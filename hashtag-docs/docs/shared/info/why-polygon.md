## We're migrating to Polygon

### Why the move?

Simply put: faster & cheaper transactions. 

Sadly, a high-volume, Web3 tagging protocol and Ethereum Mainnet are
incompatible. Therefore we are pivoting and redeploying Hashtag Protocol on
Polygon, arguably the most decentralized, battle tested & scalable Layer 2. 

### Checkout our new sandbox on Mumbai

If you want to experiment and see Hashtag Protocol in action, please head on
over to our new [testnet playground](https://dev.hashtag-protocol.org) on Polygon Mumbai.

With that interface, you can tag any NFT on Ethereum or Polygon with any hashtag
string you can imagine. If your tag is unique, a HASHTAG token (itself an NFT)
will be minted and your address is logged within it as the Creator. In the future,
if the HASHTAG token is purchased at auction, you the Creator will receive a portion
of the sale revenue.

Please note, the Mumbai sandbox is for **testing purposes only**. No tokens or
tagging data will be migrated to Polygon Mainnet.

### Early adoption opportunity

For Creators, you can continue use this interface to mint HASHTAG tokens on
Ethereum Mainnet. Mind you, it usually costs over $100 in gas.

All HASHTAG tokens on Ethereum Mainnet will be migrated immediately prior to our
launch on Polygon Mainnet. All token provenance, including hashtag string,
Creator address and Publisher address, _will be preserved_.

For Publishers, we are seeking five "launch partners" who wish to implement
decentralized tagging on their platform. Launch partners will act as exclusive
Publishers for a limited time (time length tbd).

As early adopters, launch partners will
be publisher of record for any HASHTAG tokens minted on their implementation.
If a HASHTAG token is purchased at auction, the publisher of record will receive
a portion of the sale revenue. For early publishers, this could be quite
lucrative.

### What is Hashtag Protocol?

A new, experimental Web3 tagging standard that aims to do for content tagging
what ENS, Unstoppable Domains and Handshake have done for DNS.
