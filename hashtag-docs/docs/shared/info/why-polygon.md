## Welcome to our new sandbox on Polygon Mumbai

### What is this?

This website is a sandbox implementation of Hashtag Protocol, a new Web3 tagging
standard that aims to do for content tagging what ENS, Unstoppable Domains and
Handshake have done for DNS.

Please use this interface to experiment with tagging any
NFT on Ethereum or Polygon with any hashtag string you can imagine. If the
hashtag you tag with is unique, a HASHTAG token (itself an NFT) will be minted and your
address is logged within it as the Creator. In the future, Creators
will receive a royalty when the HASHTAG token is purchased at auction.

[Learn more](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/participants.html) about Publishers, Creators & Taggers, the three
early market participants of the Hashtag Protocol.

### Front-running

This sandbox is for **testing purposes only**. Nothing in it has **real
world value** and no tokens or data will migrated to Polygon Mainnet.  

If you want to be an early adopter and mint HASHTAG tokens destined for
real world, commercial use, you may continue to do so over on
[app.hashtag-protocol.org](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org).

Mind you, minting a HASHTAG token NFT on Ethereum Mainnet usually costs over $100 in gas. However, all HASHTAG tokens minted on Ethereum mainnet _will be migrated_
immediately prior to relaunch on Polygon Mainnet. Therefore all token provenance, including hashtag
string, Creator address and Publisher address, will be preserved on Polygon.
