# Our vision for Hashtag Protocol

People around the globe use hashtags to increase discoverability and engagement
of online content. One estimate from 2017 is that on Twitter alone around 125
million hashtags are shared every day. This widespread use gives hashtags
immense social, functional and monetary value. 

While taggers certainly derive some value from tagging content, we believe the
lion's share of the value is siloed, obscured and monopolized in a few
centralized social networks.

> **We envision a paradigm shift where content tagging value streams are mediated by a decentralized crypto-economic network rather than a few central authorities.**

The result will be a global information architecture that is more freely and
efficiently accessed than today and a system with potential use cases that may
be revolutionary.

To achieve our vision, we have developed an experimental protocol consisting of
a set of Ethereum smart contracts that enables the tokenization of hashtag
strings into ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs); the “tagging” of other digital
assets with those tokens; and APIs for surfacing this data for use in networks,
platforms and applications.

Stitched into Hashtag Protocol are crypto-economic incentive mechanisms that
harness the self-interest of participants to drive positive network growth.
